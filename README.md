# Auto-Customer-Limiting-Door-Lock-System
The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus all over the world in 2020. It is advised by the
World Health Organization, WHO, that crowded places must
be avoided by people to protect themselves from the spread of
coronavirus disease and social distancing must be practiced at
all times. In order to ensure social distancing and the safety of
customers and employees at public places during the pandemic
of COVID-19, our project proposes an Arduino based auto
customer door lock system which limits the number of people
allowed inside establishments and only permits people with
normal temperature to enter in order to avoid any risks. The
system detects the temperature of the person at the entrance
using a temperature sensor (LM35) and allows the person to
enter if the temperature is inside the range but locks the door if
the temperature of the person is above the range. Two 7-segment
displays are also used where one displays the maximum number
of people allowed and the other displays the total number of
people inside. Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) at the entrance and
exit detect people entering and leaving to ensure the maximum
limit does not exceed. If the maximum limit is reached, the door
locks itself preventing anyone else to enter.
